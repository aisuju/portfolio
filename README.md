# Personal Portfolio

Project Desc.

I made this portfolio for Interdisciplinary Web Design but I loved it so much, I bought a domain for it. Now I use it as an online personal portfolio and digital resume. It is designed and developed from scratch using Netbeans and some html, css, and javascript.
